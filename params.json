It can store different in-game information. So far it uses OgameAPI and Galaxytool plugin for updating.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nDownload the archive with GLOTR sources.\r\n\r\nExtract it.\r\n\r\nGo to the /app/config directory.\r\n\r\nEdit file ServerConf.neon, please use some other editor than windows notepad, config files are whitespace sensitive! That mean, just change the value of the option, don´t delete any whitespaces! Even things like no whitespace between the end of value and a comment will rise error and your configuration won´t work! All options in configuration files are commented, so I will only point out those you really need to set:\r\n\r\nserver - your ogame server URL without / at the end\r\n\r\nAnother important options are database settings:\r\n\r\nreplace localhost with the name of your mysql server\r\n\r\nreplace glotr_devel with the name of your database\r\n\r\nreplace root with your database username and fill in your password\r\n\r\n````\t\r\n\t\tdatabase:\r\n\t\t\tdefault:\r\n\t\t\t\tdsn: 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=glotr_devel'\r\n\t\t\t\tuser: 'root'\r\n\t\t\t\tpassword: ''\r\n\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\nThen upload it to the server, visit yourdomain.com/path_to_glotr/www/install and just follow instructions.\r\n\r\n","google":""}
